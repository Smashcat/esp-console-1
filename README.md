# esp-console-1
Little hand-held ESP8266 based console with 240x320 LCD display, SDCard storage, 8 buttons and 2 sounders :) This includes an on-board programming circuit and USB serial port, so that it can be programmed easily using Arduino! Estimate around $12 in parts, including PCB, depending on PCB service and amount ordered - I used JLCPCB to buy 10.

Please note, this design is currently in production and has not been tested (although I'm pretty confident it'll work as it's an interation on a previous design).
